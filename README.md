## 1. Convolution <a name ="conv"></a> 

Convolution is a mathematical function that combines two functions to produce another function. This resulting function captures the relevant characteristics of the input functions. It plays a crucial role in extracting the essential features of an image for a recognition task.(via https://www.educative.io/answers/convolution-function-in-python)

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbour <a name = "knn"><a/>
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.(via https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-in-python/)

## 3. Linear Regression <a name ="lr"></a> 

Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. Itâ€™s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.(via https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/))
